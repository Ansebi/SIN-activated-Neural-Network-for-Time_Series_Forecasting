# SIN-activated Neural Network for Time Series Forecasting
What if use sin activation for predicting waves?<br>
Here you can find:<br>
1) wave data generator<br>
2) sin-based nn<br>
3) tests both on a sin wave and on the real data<br><br>

The multiwave case in ipynb is the way to go: the most universal and concise.<br>
The rest of the notebooks may be considered as an illustration.<br>
Multiwave notebook requires sin_nn module (the model itself)<br>
and the metrics module.
